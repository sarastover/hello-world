# hello-world
Hello!

I'm following along with the Github tutorial to understand the process because I'm currently learning PHP and am hoping it will show my code more easily than the current process I'm using.

My coding journey truly began in the fall, with the "100 Days of Code" challenge. I'd begun following a Udemy course in August, but between my computer breaking down several times in a row and spending more time at the shop than with me, and having to relearn everything each time I had it in between my full-time, non-code-related work and family, I consider the "Day 1" on Twitter as my beginning. 

I only explain so that if you see my code and think, "Hmm, seems a bit elementary," you are exactly right! We all get to start somewhere.

So here I am. Hello, world!
Sara
