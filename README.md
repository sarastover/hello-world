# hello-world
Hello!

I'm following along with the Github tutorial to understand the process because I'm currently learning PHP and am hoping it will show my code more easily than the current process I'm using.
The tutorial seems a bit outdated, so I'm hoping this works and these changes are made to the branch but not the master. Cheers!

Sara
